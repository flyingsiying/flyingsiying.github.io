I developed this model to simulate the interaction between two groups of agents (or breeds), `turtles` and `grass`. This model was inspired by the ["Wolf Sheep Predation Model"]["Wolf Sheep Predation Model"].

Here are some basic rules.
* A `turtle` has energy.
* When a turtle eats a unit of `grass`, it gains energy from grass.
* When a turtle reproduces a new turtle, it loses energy.
* When a turtle moves, it loses energy too.
* If a turtle has no energy, it dies. Otherwise, it survives.
* Last but not least, the grass might be able to regrow.

Demo:

`energy` keeps track of when the turtle is ready to reproduce and when it dies.
``` ruby
turtles-own [energy]
```

The initial number of turtles is defined by `number`. `number-of-ticks` decides how many ticks the model runs before it stops.
``` ruby
to setup
  clear-all
  setup-patches
  setup-turtles
  reset-ticks
end


to setup-patches
  ask patches [ set pcolor green ]
end


to setup-turtles
  create-turtles number [ setxy random-xcor random-ycor ]
end


to go
  if ticks >= number-of-ticks [ stop ]
  move-turtles
  eat-grass
  reproduce
  check-death
  regrow-grass
  tick
end
```

`energy-to-move` defines how much energy a turtle loses when it moves each time.
```ruby
to move-turtles
  ask turtles [
    right random 360
    forward 1
    set energy energy - energy-to-move
  ]
end
```

Users can define how much energy a turtle can get from eating a patch of grass using the `energy-from-grass` slider. If the `show-energy` switch is on, a label will be placed on each alive turtle to show its energy level. If the `show-energy` switch is off, the label is set to be an empty text.
```ruby
to eat-grass
  ask turtles [
    if pcolor = green [
      set pcolor black
      set energy (energy + energy-from-grass)
    ]
  ifelse show-energy?
    [ set label energy ]
    [ set label "" ]
  ]
end
```

If a turtle has enough to reproduce, which means its current energy is higher than the `birth-energy` defined, an offspring will be generated by attaining the `birth-energy`.
```ruby
to reproduce
  ask turtles [
    if energy > birth-energy [
      set energy energy - birth-energy
      hatch 1 [ set energy birth-energy]
    ]
  ]
end
```

A turtle dies if it has no energy left.
```ruby
to check-death
  ask turtles [
    if energy <= 0 [ die ]
  ]
end
```

The grass grows at a rate of `grass-regrowth` out of 100. This is visualized by changing the patch color to green.
```ruby
to regrow-grass
  ask patches [
    if random 100 < grass-regrowth [ set pcolor green ]
  ]
end
```
