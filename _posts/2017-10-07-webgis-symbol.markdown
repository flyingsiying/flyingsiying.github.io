Creating a symbol editing window on the Web GIS Application simply mimics the
process of symbolozing a layer in the ArcMap software. Users can symbolize
feature layers in different ways depending on the type of data they are showing.

To summarize how I made this functionality work:
* A dialog object is created in JavaScript to allow a user to enter different
settings, such as fill color or outline color.
* When a user clicks the save button, all the symbol settings will be saved as a
 configuration and attached to the layers.
* At the same time, a JavaScript function, `renderSymbology`, will be called to
render new symbols depending on render type.
* Another JavaScript function, `makeLegend`, will be called to fire any legend
changes.
* Last but not least, when a user reloads the application, layers will appear as
 how the user defines it to be from the last editing. `renderSymbology` and `makeLegend`
 functions were called again to generate the customized symbols by grabbing the updated
 symbol configuration that is attached to each layer.
